My very first programmation project

I did it as a final project in a group of 5 persons (i was the project manager)

The code isn't the best (this was our first project) and the comments are in french so, sorry for that.

I (Lamsen) did the ingame aspects, characters, images, musics, sound effects, the solo modes and i helped unearobase who did the visual aspects, the menus, the languages, and the settings.
